Eating disorders are completely associated with shame, self-disgust, poor self-image and a variety of other negative emotions. There are three main types of eating disorder namely,<br><br>1)    Anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by extreme food restriction due to the irrational fear of weight gain.<br><br>2)    Bulimia nervosa, characterized by cycles of binging and purging.<br><br>3)    Binge eating disorder, characterized by eating excessive amounts of food at one time, leading to weight gain.</p><p>Body shaming in today’s time, is unfortunately, still a relevant, prevalent and widespread social issue. The modelling industry is often looked up to since models are considered to have the body type that is considered beautiful. This perception can have a huge impact on the minds of people. However, we fail to realise that there may be a number of other factors that affect slender body types to be preferred over other body types. A well-known fashion designer in a panel discussion described, “that part of the reason why the industry prefers runway models to be so thin, is because the material used to clothe them in couture is so expensive and, it costs less to dress a thinner person.” This is not a very well-known reality as most people believe that models are preferred to look the way they do since it is what is socially acceptable. If this situation was seen through a different lens, perhaps we would be part of a world where boys and girls wouldn’t believe that “Beauty is pain”, pain that is bearable and worth undergoing.  </p><p>Victoria Secret also uses models of a particular body type, usually a size zero, to promote their brand and these very models are labelled as “angels”. In an interview Iskra Lawrence, who models for Aerie, American Eagle’s line of intimates said that she “struggled so much with body dysmorphia and disordered eating during my teenage years…because I was personally affected by images of the perfect bodies and those messages” The word model according to the Cambridge dictionary something that a copy can be based on because it is an extremely good example of its type. Imagine a lot of under-confident, impressionable girls think low of themselves because they cannot be copies of the example considered “extremely good”. </p><p>The notion about the “thin model” is gradually changing. Brands have also launched various plus-size models to pose as the ambassadors for their brands, so that they can be recognized by those models. But the very fact that they have been labelled as “plus-size” models put these changes in doubt. </p><p>Psychology as science tends to deal with solving a wide range of problems at the individual and group level. Eating disorders are serious psychiatric conditions that require proper medical care and repeated counselling process in order to instil in the sense of “acceptance” of their own body image. Psychology is a wide field with different specialisations. </p><p>Clinical psychology uses psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to treat various eating disorders. Emphasis during psychotherapy is placed on thoughts, emotions and behavioural patterns of thinking, motivations and relationships. Cognitive-behavioural therapy emphasises the evaluation of the negative thought pattern and behaviour and induces different techniques to cope up with such behaviour. For example: One study compared five months of CBT (20 sessions) for women with bulimia nervosa with two years of weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Seventy patients were randomly assigned to one of these two groups. After five months of therapy (the end of the CBT treatment), 42 percent of patients in the CBT group and 6 percent of the patients in the psychoanalytic therapy group had stopped binge-eating and purging. At the end of two years (completion of the psychoanalytic therapy), 44 percent of the CBT group and 15 percent of the psychoanalytic group were symptom-free.</p><p>Eating disorders can be prevented by generating awareness through programmers in schools and through media by promoting healthy eating habits, reducing emphasis placed on body shape and weight and helping people identify the harmful effects of pursuing the ideal thin figure.</p><p>Clinical and a counselling psychologist, uses a variety of techniques like the cognitive behaviour therapy which involves changing the thoughts and behaviour of the individuals by creating an awareness among them.</p><p>As a different field, psychology can also aim at establishing career which deals with the dietary needs of the individuals and encourage them to consume sufficient amounts of food and also feel comfortable and more confident in their own body types. </p><p>Since psychology uses variety of techniques to assist in managing the disorderly minds of those with dysmorphic perceptions of themselves, I think it could be used positively to spread the message of all body types being accepted and make spread awareness about the real reason behind the kind of models that are chosen by brands and not the reason that is assumed by most masses. It’s important that people know that there is no certain type of body image that one needs to live up to and all body types are acceptable in society without being judged. </p><p>Plus-size models are only named so so that all those people who don’t feel accepted, society has a special home where they share a common ground with similar people like them.</p>'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n        id: 1,\r\n        name:'Emergence of Sociology',\r\n        category: 'sociology',\r\n        author: '- Nidhi Bafna and Aliya Jalan',\r\n        mainpara: '<p>Questions about society have intrigued the human kind over centuries.

The consciousness among the people led them to react against the issues of contemporary society such as modernity, capitalism, rationalisation and urbanisation.</p><p>The industrial revolution was a remarkable shift from agriculture to the modern industrial sector. People in Europe had upgraded from ploughing their fields to becoming a part of the modern industries. New sources of water and energy were used  to operate large factories giving rise to issues like capitalism, exploitation of labour, class system some terms coined by a German Sociologist Karl Marx (1818-1883). French revolution dramatically changed France’s class system. For the first time there was the development of the democratic state, eliminating social distinction between people and feudal society which shifted the power from the church to its citizens.</p><p>Followed by the French revolution was the enlightenment period. It led to a change of thinking from the philosophical point of view (based on common sense & reasoning) to based on Science (Research & empirical). They started questioning the church & even the authority of the monarch slowly shifting their focus from god to science. People were now guided to take account of their own problems rather than depending on God. This shift in ideology paved the way for economic growth. This transition from church to science was hypothesized by Auguste Comte, the father of sociology, who labeled this theory as the ‘Law of Three Stages.’ The writings of philosophers like John Locke (1632-1704), Adam Smith (1723-1790) wrote about individual rights and personal liberty. People were made aware of their “inalienable rights” of “life, liberty and happiness.”</p><p>Sociology was born in the counties of England, France and Germany where these major changes had taken place.

A Clinical psychologist concentrates on the mental, emotional, biological and behavioural aspects of an individual throughout his life. They interact with patients through interviews and various tests before diagnosing and coming up with a plan to cure their mental disorder.</p><p><strong>Counselling Psychology</strong>- This type of psychology is the study of interpersonal relationships in an individual’s life. The main focus is on the emotional, social, developmental and educational problems that bring about major changes in behaviour. These psychologists use psychotherapy to examine these issues.</p><p><strong>Organizational Psychology</strong>- This type of psychology studies how human behaviour affects an industry or an organization. They detect a work situation and develop a plan for ideal performance and the right work-life balance in that situation at the workplace.</p><p><strong>Sports Psychology</strong>- Sports psychologists help athletes and sports person reach optimal performance on the field. These types of psychologists study the effect of sports on human psychology. They work with athletes, their coaches, parents, etc. to ensure rehabilitation, positive communication and team building.</p><p><strong>Food Psychology</strong>- They study the mental processes behind how and why we eat. Studies have shown that our eating habits are significantly influenced by our perception of food as well as various other social and environmental stimuli. Food can have a major effect on our mood and behaviour. Advertising and marketing strategies such as buy two get two free or using low-fat labels leave an impact on the way we shop our goods.</p><p><strong>Design Psychology</strong>- it is the practice of using psychology to make decisions regarding architecture, interior design and space planning. These psychologists strive to help people design spaces that enhance their relationship with their surroundings. They work to elicit a positive emotional response from people that reside in those places.</p><p>There have been other branches of Psychology that have been gradually coming up and Psychology as a subject still needs to be explored!</p>'        \r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n        id: 3,\r\n        name:'Dopamine',\r\n        category: 'psychology',\r\n        author: '- Nidhi Bafna and Aliya Jalan',\r\n        mainpara: '<p>Human actions are strongly influenced by the expectations of pleasure.

Engaging repeatedly in pleasure-seeking behaviour such as eating food or a sexual act causes us to experience a satisfaction. Dopamine, also known as the feel-good neurotransmitter, is responsible for repeated engagement in such behaviours. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that facilitate the transmission of nervous impulses from one nerve fibre to the other in our Central Nervous System (CNS). Based on chemical and molecular properties, there has been a classification of various neurotransmitters. Dopamine is one of the most important neurotransmitters that help in the transmission of information between neurons and signals in the vital areas of the brain</p>.<p>Dopamine was first synthesised in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England. However, in 1958 Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp discovered the function of dopamine as a neurotransmitter. Arvid Carlsson won the Noble Prize in 2000 for his research on dopamine. Dopamine is produced in different regions of the brain including the ventral tegmental area, Substantia nigra and the hypothalamus. Although dopamine is known for the pleasure molecule, it has different functions associated with different pathways. The four major dopamine pathways are neural connections in which dopamine travels to different areas of the brain and body to convey important information</p>.<p>When in the mesolimbic pathway, the neurotransmitters are involved in generating pleasure and a rewarding euphoric state which makes habits activated in this pathway addictive. Over-stimulation of this pathway causes addiction. Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines increase the dopamine levels in the body, causing pleasurable feelings. Repeated use of such drugs increases the threshold of the body, and more is required to experience greater pleasure which causes addiction to such drugs</p>.<p>The action potential when in the mesocortical pathway passes through the prefrontal cortex are concerned with cognitive memory, thinking and decision making, thus any dysfunction in this pathway may lead to hindrance in concentration or ability to coordinate decisions. The Nigrostartial pathway is the dopamine pathway concerned with motor planning and contains eighty per cent of dopamine in the brain. Deficiency of dopamine neurons in this pathway gives rise to Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder, degenerative in nature that affects motor control due to decreased levels of dopamine in this pathway. On the contrary, an over activation of dopamine causes Schizophrenia, that refers to a severe mental disorder that affects an individual’s thinking, feeling and behaving patterns</p>.<p>The last dopamine pathway is the tuberoinfundibular pathway in the hypothalamus region of the brain. Dopamine in this pathway functions to inhibit prolactin release- a protein secreted by the pituitary gland, which helps in milk production and has an important function in metabolism and sexual satisfaction</p>.<p>Dopamine is extremely significant in the expression of human emotions and study of a wide variety of human behaviour. Dopamine is also crucial in treating disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder and addictions.</p>' \r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n        id: 4,\r\n        name:'Insight into the World of Economics',\r\n        category: 'economics',\r\n        author: '- Nidhi Bafna and Aliya Jalan',\r\n        mainpara: '<p>Economics is majorly stereotyped to do with money, but is economics only about money?

What should I start with? This is a question that most of us get stuck at! Economics majorly is divided into:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Microeconomics:</strong> Covers topics related to decision making of individuals and firms regarding the allocation of scarce resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Macroeconomics:</strong> Covers topics related to decision making on the economy as a whole regarding the allocation of scarce resources.</p></li></ol><p>We would cover these branches in-depth in later blogs. We should focus our attention on the economic problems and cover the topics related to it.</p><p>The most important step now is to make a checklist of the topics to be covered:</p><ul><li>Unlimited Wants but limited resources</li><li>Scarcity</li><li>Factors of Production</li><li>Opportunity Cost </li><li>Production Possibility Curve</li></ul><h3>Understanding these Topics:</h3><p>The above-listed topics are all interconnected and form a vicious cycle. How are these subjects interrelated? We will discuss them later, but now it’s important  to understand these topics.</p><p>We have already discussed the main economic problem and the meaning of unlimited wants but limited resources. This issue gives rise to another problem of scarcity.</p><h4>Scarcity:</h4><p>Scarcity refers to a situation when there is not enough to satisfy everyone’s wants.</p><p>For example- there is not enough money as this will lead to a situation of increasing prices called inflation. </p><p>We will discuss this topic in detail later.</p><h4>Factors of Production:</h4><p>Now, which resources are these that are scarce ? These are the four factors of production:</p><ul><li>Land</li><li>Labour </li><li>Capital </li><li>Entrepreneur</li></ul><p>Let’s begin by first understanding the meaning of Factors of Production. They refer to the resources needed in the process of production like land, labour, capital and entrepreneur. Production is not possible without these factors and, all of them are equally important.</p><p>The former two factors are self-explanatory, but there is more to those concepts.</p><p>Land refers to the ground as well other exhaustible natural resources like minerals, forest resources, sunshine, water and other land resources.</p><p>Labour refers to the people working to produce a particular product or a service. In layman’s terms, labour is generally referred to physical labour but, in economics, it can also be used to refer to mental labour.</p><p><strong>For example</strong> - Doctor.</p><p>Capital refers to cash and other financial assets used in the production process. Money is considered the most liquid form of capital as it can be exchanged for any goods or services. At the same time, machinery is another examples of capital.</p><p>But what is the use of having land, labour and capital if we do not have an entrepreneur to mobilize it into a proper production process.</p><p>An Entreprenuer is the owner and risk bearer of the business. He also invests capital and keeps the profit after paying all other factors of production.</p><h4>Opportunity Cost:</h4><p>The opportunity cost is the next best alternative that is given up to produce more units of this product. This definition may be confusing for most of you’ll. Let us understand this concept with the help of an example.</p><p>For example- A person does not go to a restaurant with his friends to revise for a test. Here, the person has already studied but to get additional grades by revision he gives up the enjoyment of the  movie and the time he could have spent with his friends. Therefore, the opportunity cost of additional marks is enjoyment.</p><p>Now let us look at a production related example- A firm can produce ten pencils and two pouches with a given amount of labour. If they want to increase the production of pouches, they need to give up five units of pencils to produce one unit of a pouch. Therefore the opportunity cost of one pouch is five pencils.</p><h4>Production Possibility Curve:</h4><p>Having understood the concept of opportunity cost, we move on to understand the production possibility curve. It is a curve(graph) representing all the available combinations of output that can be produced using the given resources and technology. </p><p>Let us understand this by using a table and a graph.</p><div class=\"center col-12\"><img src=\"\" class=\"col-6\" alt=\"data\"><img class=\"col-6\" src=\"\" alt=\"ppc\"></div><p>The above table represents the best possible combinations of butter and guns that can be produced using the available resources and the given technology. We have then plotted the above data on the graph. If the firm produces on any given point inside the graph, it is said to be underutilization of resources and the firm is not operating at its maximum level.</p><p>On the other hand, impossible for the firm to operate outside the given points due to the scarcity of resources. Therefore a firm in order to produce goods using the resources optimally needs to produce on any points on the graph.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>As we had stated earlier, these topics are interconnected and form a vicious cycle.</p><p>For example- Unlimited wants and limited resources create scarcity of the factors of production. This scarcity leads the firms to have an opportunity cost to produce an additional unit of the goods. The opportunity cost gives rise to the production possibility curve.</p>'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n        id: 5,\r\n        name:'India: A Developing or Developed country?',\r\n        category: 'economics',\r\n        author: '- Nidhi Bafna and Aliya Jalan',\r\n        mainpara: '<p>India is regarded as a global poster country for dynamic growth and various opportunities for the investor.

Yet it is viewed in terms of misery because of the millions of people living in poverty. Such high populations have led to low standards of living among its citizens, and it is still on its way to economic development. Based on gross domestic product, gross national product, per-capita income and standard of living, the United Nations has classified countries into three major categories: developed countries, developing countries and underdeveloped countries. </p><p>India has been considered as a developing country because of its features like low-per capita income, the standard of living, productivity, human capital and high levels of inequality, absolute poverty and population growth. Such factors have hindered the development of the Indian economy. Post-independence, although India has developed considerably in terms of social, economic and political factors, it still has a long way to go. The per capita income remains $2005.86 as of 2018, as compared to $998.52 in 2008, showing development but yet not up to the standards of the developed nations.</p><p>Understanding India as a developing nation, we need to compare its progress from its past years. Drawing a comparison between 2008 and 2018, we analyze that the GDP of India was $ 1.2 lakh crore and there was a decrease in annual growth by 3.1% due to the financial crisis in the The World between 2008-2009. In 2018, the GDP of India was $ 2.78 lakh crores, and the growth rate was 6.12 % annual change this shows that there have been profound changes in the growth of India in ten years. Hence a development in the economy is noticed.</p><p>Indian economy is an agrarian economy, with 74% of Indian population being dependent on agriculture leading to less diversification in the economy. One of the main indicators of economic development is the shift from rural to urban jobs. But a large population of India being rural makes this shift difficult. A great part of workers suffers in low productive agriculture, while the lack of complete industrial development coupled with a humongous population of 1.353 billion (2018), a large population languishes in unemployment. According to a report by the World Bank, India’s unemployment rate stood at 5.28% of its total labour force in 2008, while at 5.33% in 2018 showing a very soft increase. 33.2% of the population of India are either over the age of sixty-five or below the age of 15, thus showing a massive economic dependency burden on the working population of India.</p><div class=\"center col-12\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TdYTAKSt6f3QbdqGhT5FkbiJ0q5KnMqT\" alt=\"Indian Economy\"></div><p>Therefore, a high population growth rate with a gigantic economic dependency burden deters the economic growth of India. This high level of unemployment has rendered a large population unable to afford basic needs like nutrition, healthcare and education and forced them to live a poor-quality life. This leads t a low human development index (HDI) of India with it being 0.647 in 2018 while it is 0.920 for the</p><p>The USA showing India has a long way towards its path of being a developed nation. Thus, due to low employment, there is a lower investment in education and health which in turn obstructs the economic growth, thus trapping India in a paradox known as the poverty trap.</p><p>Right from its inception, economic growth was high on the agenda of Independent India. The British had drained the Indian economy and had caused a large economic inequality in the country. India is yet unsuccessful in bridging the gap between the rich and the poor due to which a large population is suffering a life of extreme poverty.</p><p>India has forever strived to be a secular nation, and thus a wide variety of ethnic and social communities have settled here. While peaceful co-existence of all communities is needed, most of the country is rife with interethnic disputes with many communities facing discrimination, social exclusion and a gigantic number of other disadvantages and issues. Thus riots, political instability and hostility are not unheard of, and they unquestionably stagnate economic growth. Communal conflicts lead to widespread death and destruction as well, reducing the working population in a country.</p><p>Another major roadblock in the development of a nation is the corruption deep-rooted within the political system of a country. India is famed for the level of corruption that exists. Corruption causes the improper allocation of funds for the various policies and programmes required for the economic development of the country.</p><p>There are various factors that affect the economic development of a country, but these features are pivotal to prove India is a developing economy. The dream of India being a global economic superpower, although it is far-fetched, can be achieved. If we honestly implicate and understand the importance of these features, and formulate action plans, policies and programmes that focus on these key areas and propel India on the path of development.</p>'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n        id: 6,\r\n        name:'Sociological Perspective',\r\n        category: 'sociology',\r\n        author: '- Nidhi Bafna and Aliya Jalan',\r\n        mainpara: '<p>August Comte defined Sociology as a positive science that deals with a broad spectrum of topics like social stratification, social groups and many more!

Such solidity helps in the smooth functioning of society. Each factor in society is interdependent on each other to ensure smooth functioning.</p><p>For example, Families are dependent on the government and police to provide them with security and justice. Government organizations, on the other hand, are dependent on educational institutions to recruit the employees. If the society functions smoothly there is harmony and stability, but in the case of dysfunctions it can lead to tension, that is resolved by adaption of other mechanisms., French Sociologist, Emile Durkheim believed that in order to analyse society, one must look beyond the individuals. A deeper understanding of the social facts like laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs, fashion, and rituals that govern social life.</p><p>The functionalist perspective also further grew out of the writings of English Philosopher and Biologist Herbert Spencer, and the father of sociology Auguste Comte.</p><p>Herbert Spencer gave the theory of organic analogy and compared the parts of society to the human body. Similar to the different parts of the human body that work together for the organism to function, different parts of the society also work together to ensure the smooth operation of the society.</p><p>An American sociologist, Robert Merton, analysed the society by differences between the functions of the social structure. Some functions are considered more obvious than others. Such functions are called manifest functions. At the same time, the less important functions are known as the latent functions.</p><p>For example, the manifest function of going to college for students is to gain knowledge, whereas the latent function is to prevent unemployment and reduce the crime rate. Merton also spoke of social dysfunctions, which refers to any social pattern that hinders the operation of society.</p><h3>Social-Conflict Perspective</h3><p>In stark contrast to the structural-functionalist approach, there is the social-conflict approach that focuses on the inequity in the functioning of society. Intrigued by this approach the sociologist wanted to study how factors such as social class, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and age are linked to a society’s unequal distribution of money, power, education and social prestige. As opposed to the functionalist approach, the conflict approach focuses on how social factors are beneficial to other people. This approach mainly pivots around the ongoing conflict among the rich and the poor, men and women and the other dominant and disadvantaged groups. The two types of Social Conflict approach are-</p><h4>Feminism and Gender-Conflict Perspective</h4><p>This approach mainly focuses on the conflict between men and women and how men are placed in the position of power. It is also closely linked to feminism, which refers to the movement of gaining social equality between men and women. Since the very inception of society, women are considered among the weaker sex among the two and therefore are only limited to the household chores. With the progress of society and with the revolution of feminism, this inequality is undergoing changes, yet women are considered inferior to men which is evident from the glass ceiling effect.</p><h4>Race-Conflict Perspective</h4> <p>As the name suggests the race conflict refers to the inequality between the different racial and ethnic categories. People of colours are perceived as slaves and therefore face a social disadvantage in terms of schooling, better health and longer life expectancy.</p><p>The main criticism of this approach is that it mainly focuses on inequality and ignores the interdependence of members of society. Another problem with this approach is it views society in broader terms such as family, social class, race, etc. Invariant to this is the symbolic interactionist approach, which focuses the society in general and everyday terms.</p><h3>The Symbolic-Interactionalist Perspective</h3><p>This perspective is born out of the ideas of German sociologist Max Weber. He emphasized that people work according to their understanding of the society and that’s focused on the social interaction among the people. Another American sociologist named George H Mead believed that individuals behave according to their understanding of the world. According to this perspective, people attach meaning to the symbols. These meanings might differ from culture to culture and society to society. These symbols carry different meanings to the sender and the receiver. For example, wine is considered holy among the Christian community, whereas this a taboo in Islam.</p><p>The main criticism of this perspective is that it fails to see the society in a larger picture, which means the interactionist might miss the bigger issues of the society while focussing on the smaller ones.</p><p>In order to analyse any topics of sociology, an understanding of these perspectives is important.</p>'\r\n        },\r\n    ];","import React,{ Component } from 'react';\r\nimport { BLOGS } from '../data/blogs';\r\n\r\nclass SearchResult extends Component{\r\n    constructor(props){\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            blogs: BLOGS\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n        return(\r\n            <div></div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SearchResult;","export const SUBJECTS =\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n    id: 0,\r\n    name:'psychology',\r\n    titleline: '“Out of your vulnerabilities will come your strength” <br>– Sigmund Freud',\r\n    titleimage:'<img src=\"https://thehelpingbookk.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/logo1.png\">'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n    id: 1,\r\n    name:'economics',\r\n    titleline: '“Welcome to the Wonderful World of Economics.
